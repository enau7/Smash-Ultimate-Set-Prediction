# Smash Ultimate Set Prediction
 
This project can be viewed at [smashsetprediction.netlify.app](https://smashsetprediction.netlify.app). This set of files is incomplete and many of the jupyter notebooks will not run in their current state. This is because the data was left out of this project in order to save space and be uploaded to Github. If you want to run these files, first go to [github.com/smashdata/ThePlayerDatabase](https://github.com/smashdata/ThePlayerDatabase) and download the file `ultimate_player_database.zip`. Extract `ultimate_player_database.db` and move this file into the *Data/data* folder. Then, run `data_compilation.ipynb`. Most of the jupyter notebook files will work at this point, except `model_testing.ipynb`. To make this file usable, go to `model_fitting.ipynb` and run any cells that contain the models in `model_testing.ipynb`. Alternatively, you can run the whole `model_fitting.ipynb` file, however, it will take several hours.
